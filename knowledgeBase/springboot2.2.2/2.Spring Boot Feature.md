# <center>Spring Boot Feature</center>

In many situations, you can delegate to the static *SpringApplication.run* method, as shown in the following example
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MySpringConfiguration.class, args);
}
```

## 壹、Startup Log

+ what
+ why
+ how(can we do)
    + setting log levels
    + turn off logging
    + To add additional logging during startup, you can override logStartupInfo(boolean) in a subclass of SpringApplication.

## 贰、Startup Failure

+ what
    + If your application fails to start, registered FailureAnalyzers get a chance to provide a dedicated error message and a concrete action to fix the problem
+ why
+ how
    + Spring Boot provides numerous FailureAnalyzer implementations, and you can add your own.
    + as follow
        ```git
        $ java -jar myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --debug
        ```

## 叁、Lazy Initialization

+ what
    + When lazy initialization is enabled, beans are created as they are needed rather than during application startup
    + shortcoming
        + A downside of lazy initialization is that it can delay the discovery of a problem with the application
        + Care must also be taken to ensure that the JVM has sufficient memory to accommodate all of the application’s beans and not just those that are initialized during startup.
+ why
+ how
    + lazy initialization is not enabled by default and it is recommended that ==fine-tuning of the JVM’s heap size== is done before enabling lazy initialization.

## 肆、Customizing the Banner

+ what
    The banner that is printed on start up
+ why
+ how
    + The banner can be changed by adding a banner.txt file to your classpath or by setting the spring.banner.location property to the location of such a file
    + If the file has an encoding other than UTF-8, you can set ==spring.banner.charset==
    + The SpringApplication.setBanner(…​) method can be used if you want to generate a banner programmatically. Use the org.springframework.boot.Banner interface and implement your own printBanner() method.

## 伍、Customizing SpringApplication

+ what
+ why
+ how
    + If the SpringApplication defaults are not to your taste, you can instead create a local instance and customize it. For example, to turn off the banner, you could write:
        ```java
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(MySpringConfiguration.class);
            app.setBannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF);
            app.run(args);
        }
        ```

## 陆、Fluent Builder API

+ what
+ why
+ how
  + If you need to build an ApplicationContext hierarchy (multiple contexts with a parent/child relationship) or if you prefer using a “fluent” builder API, you can use the SpringApplicationBuilder.The SpringApplicationBuilder lets you chain together multiple method calls and includes parent and child methods that let you create a hierarchy, as shown in the following example
    ```java
    new SpringApplicationBuilder()
        .sources(Parent.class)
        .child(Application.class)
        .bannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF)
        .run(args);
    ```
